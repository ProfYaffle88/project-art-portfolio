# Surface

## Design 
The priority of the artist/client is to showcase their work. We decided that a clean, monochrome style would highlight the colourful work of the artist. The dominant background colour will be grey, header/footer will be a significantly darker grey, text will be a very pale grey and appear over the same darker grey used for the header and footer; this will maximise contrast and visibility while not disctracting the eye from the art on display. The artist would like this site to generate both awareness and work, so prominent buttons will appear on the landing page directing the user to the appropriate page. The contact form page should have a required radio button for "nature of enquiry" to allow the artist to filter their incoming messages.
